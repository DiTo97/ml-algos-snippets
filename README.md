- *rubix-divorce-predictor*, contains an example of classical ML, with a k-NN model performing binary classification on a 54-dimensional feature vector to predict a couple's divorce likelyhood. This example was built with the [Rubix ML](https://rubixml.com/) library written in PHP, the first competitive ML library which exploits the JIT capabilities of said language.
